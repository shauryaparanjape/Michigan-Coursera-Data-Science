1. After training a ridge regression model, you find the the training and test set accuracies are 0.98 and 0.54 respectively. Which of the following would be the best choice for the next ridge regression model you train?
"You are overfitting, the next model trained should have a higher value for alpha"

2. After training a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel SVM, you decide to increase the influence of each training point and to simplify 
"Decrease C and gamma"

3.Which of the following is an example of multiclass classification? (Select all that apply)
"Classify a set of fruits as apples, oranges, bananas, or lemons"

4. Looking at the plot below which shows accuracy scores for different values of a regularization parameter lambda, what value of lambda is the best choice for generalization?
'10'

5. Suppose you are interested in finding a parsimonious model (the model that accomplishes the desired level of prediction with as few predictor variables as possible) 	
"Lasso Regression"

6. Match the plots of SVM margins below to the values of the C parameter that correspond to the
"0.1, 1, 10"

7. Use Figures A and B below to answer questions 7, 8, 9, and 10.
"Figure A: Ridge Regression, Figure B: Lasso Regression" varying was ridge, tending to zero was lasso

11. Which of the following is true of cross-validation? (Select all that apply)

"Fits multiple models on different splits of the data/Increases generalization ability and computational complexity/Helps prevent knowledge about the test set from leaking into the model"
